	abstract = {Dams strongly impair the fluvial environment by altering downstream flows. We analysed riverscapes downstream of three dams and hypothesized that different dam types in rivers with diverse history of land-use and land cover (LULC) change have significant riparian cover differences at diverse biogeomorphic units (banks, riverbanks, islands). We performed a temporal comparison using pre-dam (1965) and post-dam (2013) high-resolution airborne imagery. A new approach was devised to correct the spatial offset between historical and contemporary imagery. Riparian vegetation and LULC (200m-buffer) were mapped in three rivers of Portugal regulated by the dams Touvedo (run-of-river), Vilarinho das Furnas and Fronhas (storage reservoirs). Five landscape metrics, measures of shape complexity, area and edge effect of riparian patches were computed, including the Weighted Class Area, a metric developed to better interpret the landscape variation. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of highly altered riverscapes in the post-dam period. For all case studies riparian patches are presently larger, but with less complex shapes and smaller edges. In the present study riparian patches encroach into the river channel, occupy more area and are larger at the two reservoir rivers than at the run-of-river setting. Riparian growth trajectory at the latter is mainly outwards from the active channel and non-vegetated areas in riverbanks and banks are significantly larger; likely due to the washing flows. Redundancy analyses indicated that riparian change was driven by both LULC (agricultural land abandonment and unmanaged forests) and hydrological alterations that jointly determine the structure and spatial trajectories of riparian expansion.},

	abstract = {Research on reservoir sedimentation in recent years has been aimed mainly at water resources projects in developing countries. These countries, especially in Africa, often have to cope with long droughts, flash floods and severe erosion problems. Large reservoir capacities are required to capture water provided by flash floods so as to ensure the supply of water in periods of drought. The problem arising however is that these floods, due to their tremendous stream power, carry enormous volumes of sediment which, due to the size of reservoirs, are virtually deposited in toto in the reservoir basin, leading to fast deterioration of a costly investment. Accurate forecasting of reservoir behaviour is therefore of the utmost importance. This book fills a gap in current literature by providing in one volume comprehensive coverage of techniques required to practically investigate the effects sediment deposition in reservoirs has on the viability of water resources projects.},

	abstract = {The erosion behaviour of various fine-grained sediment deposits has been investigated in laboratory experiments. This work mainly focused on tests using sewer sediment in which strong biochemical reactions were observed during the deposit formation period. A small number of initial tests were conducted in which the deposits were made from mixtures of “clean” mineral and organic sediments. The erosion behaviour observed in these tests was compared with the erosion characteristics for sediments taken from deposits in a sewer. The impact of the biological processes on physical properties such as bulk density, water content, deposit structure and the erosive behaviour as a function of bed shear stress are quantified and discussed. Based on these observations it is believed that bio-processes weaken the strength of the in-pipe sediment deposits. A significantly weaker sediment surface layer was observed during deposition under quiescent oxygen-rich conditions. This resulted in a deposit with low shear strength which may be a cause of a first foul flush of suspended sediment when flow rates were increased. Comparison between tests with sewer sediments and the artificial representative surrogates suggested that the deposits of the later did not correctly simulate the depositional development and the resultant erosion patterns observed with the more bio-active sewer sediment.},

These matrix-enclosed and surface-attached microbial communities are ubiquitous, prolific and highly active at the interfaces of the streambed. The biofilm mode of life is advantageous in streams with a fast flow of water and continuous export of nutrients and organic matter.Biofilms in streams can be considered a 'microbial skin', regulating the processing and export of nutrients and organic matter from catchments and influencing the dispersal of microorganisms and their biodiversity dynamics at the scale of entire stream networks.Interactions between the growth of biofilms, streamwater flow and substratum chemistry produce emergent environmental complexity in the streambed.Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes often dominate the communities of stream biofilms. Flavobacteriia and Sphingobacteriia seem to be especially important members of these communities. Archaea are found within niche microenvironments established by the metabolic activity of other microorganisms.High biodiversity in stream biofilms is supported by continuous input of microorganisms from upstream catchments, environmental sorting induced by habitat heterogeneity (ranging from the scale of the biofilm to large stream networks) and episodic disturbance from streamwater flow.New interdisciplinary approaches are needed to link structure and function of biofilms to their environment and, ultimately, to ecosystem processes and biogeochemical fluxes in streams. This is crucial to understand and predict implications of global ecosystem change and climate change on the microbial ecology and functioning of stream ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Reservoirs are a globally significant source of methane (CH4), although most measurements have been made in tropical and boreal systems draining undeveloped watersheds. To assess the magnitude of CH4 emissions from reservoirs in midlatitude agricultural regions, we measured CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates from William H. Harsha Lake (Ohio, U.S.A.), an agricultural impacted reservoir, over a 13 month period. The reservoir was a strong source of CH4 throughout the year, emitting on average 176 ± 36 mg C m–2 d–1, the highest reservoir CH4 emissions profile documented in the United States to date. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the largest CH4 emissions were during summer stratified conditions, not during fall turnover. The river–reservoir transition zone emitted CH4 at rates an order of magnitude higher than the rest of the reservoir, and total carbon emissions (i.e., CH4 + CO2) were also greater at the transition zone, indicating that the river delta supported greater carbon mineralization rates than elsewhere. Midlatitude agricultural impacted reservoirs may be a larger source of CH4 to the atmosphere than currently recognized, particularly if river deltas are consistent CH4 hot spots. We estimate that CH4 emissions from agricultural reservoirs could be a significant component of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the U.S.A.},

	abstract = {In order to classify the relative importance of the parameters governing the accumulation of biofilm in drinking water distribution systems, a study has been carried out, using an industrial pilot plant fed with finished waters, with three main objectives, viz. (i) determination of biofilm density on pipe surfaces (PVC or cement lined cast iron) as a function of the distance from the water treatment plant, (ii) evaluation of the growth rate of attached bacteria along the distribution system, and (iii) measurement of the behavior of the dissolved organic matter (DOC) in the water stream for system residence times of 40 to 240 h. Biofilms were found to comprise a complex mixture of microorganisms, viz. fungi, yeasts, protozoa (Bodo sp.), free amoebae (Hartmannela, Vannella, Cochliopodium and Naegleria), and bacteria (up to 106 cells.cm−2), 19\% of which were actively respiring as determined by the INT method. The densities of attached bacteria and the proportions of active bacteria decreased slowly along the distribution system and fitted a non‐linear polynomial regression model with six significant terms. The highest growth rate of attached bacteria was observed at the beginning of the experimental network (μ = 0.0017 h−1 or g = 17 d with no residual chlorine at 25°C), i.e. where the system receives the highest flux of biodegradable organic matter. The apparent doubling time of attached cells in drinking water networks might be expected to be generally relatively low (more than 100 d) because of the rapid consumption of biodegradable organic matter (within 40 to 80 h at 25°C when there is no chlorine in the water). In large water distribution systems, far from the water treatment plant, the analysis of drinking water quality gives more circumstantial information on the ecology of attached cells (biofilm) than on water treatment efficiency.},

The short generation time, sessile nature, responsiveness to environmental conditions and the availability of sound, quantitative methodologies make biofilms suitable as a monitoring tool in these systems. This paper describes biofilm structure, function and development through the processes of succession and disturbance. Biofilms are assemblages of algae, fungi and microorganisms which cover rocks, wood and sediments in aquatic systems. A review of biofilm collection and processing techniques using relevant Australian and international studies reveals a large literature on many structural and functional biofilm attributes. Studies using structural attributes such as biomass and diversity to examine water quality impacts and invertebrate grazers dominate the Australian literature. More recently, studies have used functional biofilm attributes such as metabolism and foodweb interactions. Monitoring programs that combine structural and functional biofilm attributes will allow the best assessment of impacts in riverine systems. Biofilm functional parameters provide an integrated, long-term measure of ecosystem function, with structural attributes such as biomass and diversity allowing historical comparisons with previously recorded datasets. Monitoring programs such as these with a well-founded scientific base and defined management outcomes will expand our knowledge of river function and contribute to the restoration of Australian river systems.},

	abstract = {Global warming has been shown to strongly influence inland water systems, producing noticeable increases in water temperatures. Rising temperatures, especially when combined with widespread nutrient pollution, directly favour the growth of toxic cyanobacteria. Climate changes have also altered natural water level fluctuations increasing the probability of extreme events as dry periods followed by heavy rains. The massive appearance of Dolichospermum lemmermannii ( = planktonic Anabaena), a toxic species absent from the pelagic zone of the subalpine oligotrophic Lake Maggiore before 2005, could be a consequence of the unusual fluctuations of lake level in recent years. We hypothesized that these fluctuations may favour the cyanobacterium as result of nutrient pulses from the biofilms formed in the littoral zone when the lake level is high. To help verify this, we exposed artificial substrates in the lake, and evaluated their nutrient enrichment and release after desiccation, together with measurements of fluctuations in lake level, precipitation and D.lemmermannii population. The highest percentage of P release and the lowest C∶P molar ratio of released nutrients coincided with the summer appearance of the D.lemmermannii bloom. The P pulse indicates that fluctuations in level counteract nutrient limitation in this lake and it is suggested that this may apply more widely to other oligotrophic lakes. In view of the predicted increase in water level fluctuations due to climate change, it is important to try to minimize such fluctuations in order to mitigate the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms.},

	abstract = {Biotic and abiotic surfaces in marine waters are rapidly colonized by microorganisms. Surface colonization and subsequent biofilm formation and development provide numerous advantages to these organisms and support critical ecological and biogeochemical functions in the changing marine environment. Microbial surface association also contributes to deleterious effects such as biofouling, biocorrosion, and the persistence and transmission of harmful or pathogenic microorganisms and their genetic determinants. The processes and mechanisms of colonization as well as key players among the surface-associated microbiota have been studied for several decades. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific cell-surface, cell-cell, and interpopulation interactions shape the composition, structure, spatiotemporal dynamics, and functions of surface-associated microbial communities. Several key microbial processes and mechanisms, including (i) surface, population, and community sensing and signaling, (ii) intraspecies and interspecies communication and interaction, and (iii) the regulatory balance between cooperation and competition, have been identified as critical for the microbial surface association lifestyle. In this review, recent progress in the study of marine microbial surface colonization and biofilm development is synthesized and discussed. Major gaps in our knowledge remain. We pose questions for targeted investigation of surface-specific community-level microbial features, answers to which would advance our understanding of surface-associated microbial community ecology and the biogeochemical functions of these communities at levels from molecular mechanistic details through systems biological integration.},

	abstract = {Biofilms, consisting of microorganisms and their secreted extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), serve as “ecosystem engineers” stabilizing sedimentary environments. Natural sediment bed provides an excellent substratum for biofilm growth. The porous structure and rich nutrients allow the EPS matrix to spread deeper into the bed. A series of laboratory-controlled experiments were conducted to investigate sediment colonization of Bacillus subtilis and the penetration of EPS into the sediment bed with incubation time. In addition to EPS accumulation on the bed surface, EPS also penetrated downward. However, EPS distribution developed strong vertical heterogeneity with a much higher content in the surface layer than in the bottom layer. Scanning electron microscope images of vertical layers also displayed different micromorphological properties of sediment-EPS matrix. In addition, colloidal and bound EPSs exhibited distinctive distribution patterns. After the full incubation, the biosedimentary beds were eroded to test the variation of bed stability induced by biological effects. This research provides an important reference for the prediction of sediment transport and hence deepens the understanding of the biologically mediated sediment system and broadens the scope of the burgeoning research field of “biomorphodynamics.”},

	abstract = {Although prokaryotes are small in size, they are a significant biomass component in aquatic ecosystems and play a major role in biogeochemical processes. It is generally assumed that the relative importance of prokaryotes to material and energy fluxes is maximized in low-productivity (oligotrophic) ecosystems and decreases in high-productivity (eutrophic) ecosystems. Lagoon and coastal ecosystems are extremely dynamic, typically highly productive and dominated by macro-size organisms (both macrofauna and macrophytes). As such, their functional characteristics are typically evaluated from a “macrobial” perspective. An efficient ecosystem functioning, with fast nutrient cycling, high productivity, low C accumulation and lack of hypoxic/dystrophic crises is, however, intimately dependent on the interaction between microbial and macrobial organisms. We make here an attempt to relate prokaryote biodiversity (genotype richness, using fingerprinting techniques, ARISA) and ecosystem functioning (using a series of parameters including meiofaunal biomass, prokaryote C production and organic matter turnover rates) in different Mediterranean lagoon systems. The lagoons differed significantly with each other for all the variables. While no relationships were observed between the environmental characteristics of the lagoons and the bacterial diversity, the latter was significantly and positively correlated with the functioning and efficiency of the lagoons. The investigation of the links between microbial diversity and functioning in lagoons is still at its infancy, but these preliminary results suggest that a better understanding of the role of prokaryote diversity on ecosystem functioning and efficiency could open new perspectives for the conservation and management of these highly productive and vulnerable ecosystems.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the different stakeholder based discourses and challenges around the Franconian Lake District (FLD), a recently constructed large reservoir system in Germany. The construction and operation of reservoirs represent a massive alteration of their natural and social environments leading to discourses and potential conflicts between a wide scope of heterogeneous interest patterns. Studies have shown that large reservoirs can be an important contributor to water supply, irrigation, energy storage and therefore climate change mitigation on a global scale, which brings these conflicting interests to a broader societal concern. Yet, information about conflicts around existing (German) reservoirs is limited. To assess which issues and conflicts appear on the daily agenda and how they are perceived, communicated and addressed by the stakeholders, a total of 609 articles in the N\&uuml;rnberger Nachrichten and 22 semi-structured expert interviews were analysed, using qualitative content analysis. The results show that discourses at FLD are predominantly determined by economic factors. Management issues are dominated by discussions about cyanobacteria, which can pose a health risk, thereby impeding recreational use of the lakes and consequently causing economic losses and an image problem for the region. The issue is also strongly interlinked with other aspects of concern and therefore one of the main challenges at the FLD. Due to the construction of the lakes and the evolving strong tourism sector, the formerly agricultural region was subject to a major structural change linking together a very heterogeneous set of interests. The results of this study can help in establishing a management framework to suit all stakeholders and possibly be transferrable to similar projects.},

	abstract = {The sediment-stabilizing effect of benthic diatoms was investigated in a laboratory setting. Axenic cultures of the benthic diatoms Nitzschia cf. brevissima and Cylindrotheca closterium were inoculated in Petri dishes containing sand and incubated under axenic conditions. By ensuring aseptic routines throughout the experiments, interference from other organisms occurring with diatoms in natural photothrophic biofilms was avoided. This allowed the examination of the role of benthic diatoms in sediment stabilization. Increases in the critical erosion shear stress of the sediment were observed in the presence of both diatom taxa relative to sterile sediment. However, N. cf. brevissima was more effective than C. closterium. Values of critical shear stress in the experimental system were in the same range as those observed in natural biofilms, which indicates that diatoms are important agents for biogenic stabilization. Extracellular carbohydrate contents in the microcosms were similar for both diatom species. However, in the presence of N cf. brevissima, extracellular carbohydrate correlated significantly to critical shear stress, explaining up to 80\% of the variation, whereas this was not the case for C. closterium. Therefore, it was concluded that the quantity of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) alone did not explain the biogenic stabilization. Observed adsorption of EPS to sediment particles depended on the relative amount of uronic acids in the exopolymers. Using fluorescently labeled lectins, confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that EPS secretion by N. cf. brevissima resulted in ordered three-dimensional matrix structures. It is suggested that the structuring of EPS plays an prominent role in the process of biostabilization, and that diatoms such as N. cf. brevissima are actively involved in producing the structure of EPS, whereas others such as C. closterium do not do so to the same extent.},

The methane (CH4) sources, sinks and fluxes were estimated from water and pore water concentrations, from chamber flux measurements at the sediment–air (low tide), sediment–water and water–air (high tide) interfaces, and from potential oxidation and production rate measurements in sediments. CH4 concentrations in waters were maximal (500–1000 nmol l−1) in river waters and in tidal creeks at low tide, and minimal in the lagoon at high tide ({\textless}50 nmol l−1). The major CH4 sources are continental waters and the tidal pumping of sediment pore waters at low tide. Methanogenesis occurred in the tidal flat sediments, in which pore water concentrations were relatively high (2.5–8.0 μmol l−1). Nevertheless, the sediment was a minor CH4 source for the water column and the atmosphere because of a high degree of anaerobic and aerobic CH4 oxidation in sediments. Atmospheric CH4 fluxes at high and low tide were low compared to freshwater wetlands. Temperate tidal lagoons appear to be very minor contributor of CH4 to global atmosphere and to open ocean.},

Measurements using gas traps indicated very high ebullition rates, but due to the stochastic nature of ebullition a mass balance approach was crucial to deduce system-wide methane sources and losses. Methane diffusion from the sediment was generally low and seasonally stable and did not account for the high concentration of dissolved methane measured in the reservoir discharge. A strong positive correlation between water temperature and the observed dissolved methane concentration enabled us to quantify the dissolved methane addition from bubble dissolution using a system-wide mass balance. Finally, knowing the contribution due to bubble dissolution, we used a bubble model to estimate bubble emission directly to the atmosphere. Our results indicated that the total methane emission from Lake Wohlen was on average {\textgreater}150 mg CH4 m−2 d−1, which is the highest ever documented for a midlatitude reservoir. The substantial temperature-dependent methane emissions discovered in this 90-year-old reservoir indicate that temperate water bodies can be an important but overlooked methane source.},

Surprisingly, some of these cyanobacteria are ingested voluntarily. Indeed, for centuries mankind has used cyanobacteria as a protein source, primarily Spirulina species. However, recently also Aphanizomenon flos–aquae are used for the production of so called blue green algae supplements (BGAS), supposedly efficacious for treatment of various diseases and afflictions. Unfortunately, traces of neurotoxins and protein phosphatases (inhibiting compounds) have been detected in BGAS, making these health supplements a good example for human exposure to a mixture of cyanobacterial toxins in a complex matrix.

While the positive relationship between total cyanobacteria biovolume and P concentration disappeared at high P concentrations, cyanobacteria biovolume increased continually with N concentration, indicating potential N limitation in highly P enriched lakes. The biovolumes of all cyanobacterial taxa were higher in lakes with above average joint NP concentrations, although the relative biovolumes of some Nostocales were higher in less enriched lakes. Taxa were found to have diverse responses to differential N versus P concentration, and the differences between taxa were not consistent with the hypothesis that potentially N2-fixing Nostocales taxa would be favoured in low N relative to P conditions. In particular Aphanizomenon gracile and the subtropical invasive species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii often reached their highest biovolumes in lakes with high nitrogen relative to phosphorus concentration. Concentrations of all cyanotoxin groups increased with increasing TP and TN, congruent with the biovolumes of their likely producers. Microcystin concentration was strongly correlated with the biovolume of Planktothrix agardhii but concentrations of anatoxin, cylindrospermopsin and paralytic shellfish poison were not strongly related to any individual taxa. Cyanobacteria should not be treated as a single group when considering the potential effects of changes in nutrient loading on phytoplankton community structure and neither should the N2-fixing Nostocales. This is of particular importance when considering the occurrence of cyanotoxins, as the two most abundant potentially toxin producing Nostocales in our study were found in lakes with high N relative to P enrichment.},

Such information can support the identification of environmental flow guidelines and a sustainable water management that balances the water demands of humans and ecosystems. This study presents the first global assessment of the anthropogenic alteration of river flow regimes, in particular of flow variability, by water withdrawals and dams/reservoirs. Six ecologically relevant flow indicators were quantified using an improved version of the global water model WaterGAP. WaterGAP simulated, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, river discharge as affected by human water withdrawals and dams around the year 2000, as well as naturalized discharge without this type of human interference. Compared to naturalized conditions, long-term average global discharge into oceans and internal sinks has decreased by 2.7\% due to water withdrawals, and by 0.8\% due to dams. Mainly due to irrigation, long-term average river discharge and statistical low flow \textit{Q}$_{\textrm{90}}$ (monthly river discharge that is exceeded in 9 out of 10 months) have decreased by more than 10\% on one sixth and one quarter of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland), respectively. \textit{Q}$_{\textrm{90}}$ has increased significantly on only 5\% of the land area, downstream of reservoirs. Due to both water withdrawals and reservoirs, seasonal flow amplitude has decreased significantly on one sixth of the land area, while interannual variability has increased on one quarter of the land area mainly due to irrigation. It has decreased on only 8\% of the land area, in areas downstream of reservoirs where consumptive water use is low. The impact of reservoirs is likely underestimated by our study as small reservoirs are not taken into account. Areas most affected by anthropogenic river flow alterations are the Western and Central USA, Mexico, the western coast of South America, the Mediterranean rim, Southern Africa, the semi-arid and arid countries of the Near East and Western Asia, Pakistan and India, Northern China and the Australian Murray-Darling Basin, as well as some Arctic rivers. Due to a large number of uncertainties related e.g. to the estimation of water use and reservoir operation rules, the analysis is expected to provide only first estimates of river flow alterations that should be refined in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Changes in the budget of dissolved methane measured in a small temperate lake over 1 year indicate that anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and the autumn overturn period represent key factors for the overall annual methane emissions from lakes. During periods of stable stratification, large amounts of methane accumulate in anoxic deep waters. Approximately 46\% of the stored methane was emitted during the autumn overturn, contributing ∼80\% of the annual diffusive methane emissions to the atmosphere. After the overturn period, the entire water column was oxic, and only 1\% of the original quantity of methane remained in the water column. Current estimates of global methane emissions assume that all of the stored methane is released, whereas several studies of individual lakes have suggested that a major fraction of the stored methane is oxidized during overturns. Our results provide evidence that not all of the stored methane is released to the atmosphere during the overturn period. However, the fraction of stored methane emitted to the atmosphere during overturn may be substantially larger and the fraction of stored methane oxidized may be smaller than in the previous studies suggesting high oxidation losses of methane. The development or change in the vertical extent and duration of the anoxic hypolimnion, which can represent the main source of annual methane emissions from small lakes, may be an important aspect to consider for impact assessments of climate warming on the methane emissions from lakes.},

	abstract = {Regular occurrences of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens have been observed in several lakes that have undergone recent re-oligotrophication, e.g. Lake Ammersee. Planktothrix species are known to produce microcystins, potent phosphatase inhibitors that have been associated with morbidities and mortalities in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to characterise the temporal and spatial abundance and toxicity of P. rubescens in Lake Ammersee. P. rubescens cell densities and biovolumes were calculated via fluorescence image analyses. P. rubescens was present during the entire observation period from 1999 to 2004, albeit at different cell densities. Maximum biovolumes of 45cm3m−2 were observed in May 2001. Filaments were regularly distributed over the entire water column during winter and stratified in distinct metalimnic layers during summer, reaching maximum cell densities of ≤15,000 (winter) and ≤77,000cellsml−1 (summer). The results demonstrate that P. rubescens abundance is strongly influenced by water transparency, i.e. illumination in the metalimnion. Moreover, the P. rubescens abundance appears to result from regular phosphate depletion in the epilimnion, possibly additionally benefiting from high nitrogen loads. Microcystin (MC) was detectable in 27 and 38 of 54 seston samples via HPLC and Adda-ELISA measurements, respectively. The main microcystin congeners in the seston samples were [Asp3]-MC-RR and [Asp3,Dhb7]-MC-RR. Microcystin concentrations correlated significantly with the respective phycoerythrin (PE)-concentrations. The variation in the MC/PE-ratios was low suggesting that the microcystin production of P. rubescens in Lake Ammersee is consistent and indicates that the appearance of P. rubescens coincides with measurable microcystin levels. Moreover, the observation of pronounced metalimnic oxygen depletions appears to be causally related to recurring high P. rubescens abundance. In conclusion the results suggest that aquatic organisms such as indigenous fish populations (e.g. coregonids) are regularly confronted with potentially adverse P. rubescens densities, which might provide a possible explanation for the often observed impaired health and growth retardation of coregonid populations in P. rubescens containing pre-alpine lakes.},

Biofilm cultivation was performed in a recirculating flume for three different periods (5, 10 and 15 days) under ambient temperature and with sufficient nutrients supply. Three groups of size-fractionated sediment were sequentially used, including 0–0.02 mm, 0.02–0.05 mm and 0.05–0.10 mm. Desired conditions for erosion and deposition were designed by managing high bed shear stress at the narrow part of upstream flume and low shear stress at the wide part of downstream flume. Biostabilization and transport characteristics of the biofilm coated sediment (bio-sediment) were strongly influenced by the cultivation period, and the results were compared with clean sediment. The bio-sediment was more resistant to erosion, and the mean shear stress was increased by factors of 2.65, 2.73 and 5.01 for sediment with 5, 10 and 15 days of biofilm growth compared with clean sediment, resulting in less sediment being eroded from the bed. Simultaneously, the settling velocity was smaller for bio-sediment due to higher organic content and porosity (i.e., lower density). Additionally, there was a smaller probability of deposition for sediment with a longer cultivation period after erosion, resulting in more retention time in aquatic systems. These results will benefit water management in natural rivers.},

Understanding the changes associated with biofilm growth and quantifying the time scales over which these changes occur are important for understanding how biofilms mediate sediment properties and processes and the development of sediment transport mechanics. The effect of biofilm on the rheological properties of cohesive sediment was investigated experimentally. The rheological properties of sediment slurries with and without biofilm at different growth phases were measured and compared. Measurement showed biofilm growth has a significant effect on the rheological properties of cohesive sediment. Rheological equations for biofilm sediment and expressions for rheological properties which change over time are proposed. These equations, and information on biofilm sediment, are important for inclusion of biosedimentological processes in models of sediment dynamics.},

	abstract = {Most natural sediment is invariably covered by biofilms in reservoirs and lakes, which have significant influence on bed form dynamics and sediment transport, and also play a crucial role in natural river evolution, pollutant transport, and habitat changes. However, most models for sediment transport are based on experiments using clean sediments without biological materials. In this study, a three-dimensional mathematical model of hydrodynamics and sediment transport is presented with a comprehensive consideration of the biofilm effects. The changes of the bed resistance mainly due to the different bed form dynamics of the biofilm-coated sediment (biosediment), which affect the hydrodynamic characteristics, are considered. Moreover, the variations of parameters related to sediment transport after the biofilm growth are integrated, including the significant changes of the incipient velocity, settling velocity, reference concentration, and equilibrium bed load transport rate. The proposed model is applied to evaluate the effects of biofilms on the hydrodynamic characteristics and sediment transport in laboratory experiments. Results indicate that the mean velocity increases after the biofilm growth, and the turbulence intensity near the river bed decreases under the same flow condition. Meanwhile, biofilm inhibits sediment from moving independently. Thus, the moderate erosion is observed for biosediment resulting in smaller suspended sediment concentrations. The proposed model can reasonably reflect these sediment transport characteristics with biofilms, and the approach to integration of the biological impact could also be used in other modeling of sediment transport, which can be further applied to provide references for the integrated management of natural aqueous systems.},

	abstract = {1. The microbial metabolism of organic matter in rivers has received little study compared with that of small streams. Therefore, we investigated the rate and location of bacterial production in a sixth-order lowland river (Spree, Germany). To estimate the contribution of various habitats (sediments, epiphyton, and the pelagic zone) to total bacterial production, we quantified the contribution of these habitats to areal production by bacteria. 2. Large areas of the river bottom were characterized by loose and shifting sands of relatively homogenous particle size distribution. Aquatic macrophytes grew on 40\% of the river bottom. Leaf areas of 2.8 m2 m−2 river bottom were found in a 6.6 km river stretch. 3. The epiphyton supported a bacterial production of 5–58 ng C cm−2 h−1. Bacterial production in the pelagic zone was 0.9–3.9 μg C L−1 h−1, and abundance was 4.0–7.8 × 109 cells L−1. Bacterial production in the uppermost 2 cm of sediments ranged from 1 to 8 μg C cm−3 h−1, and abundance from 0.84 to 6.7 × 109 cells cm−3. Bacteria were larger and more active in sediments than in the pelagic zone. 4. In spite of relatively low macrophyte abundance, areal production by bacteria in the pelagic zone was only slightly higher than in the epiphyton. Bacterial biomass in the uppermost 2 cm of sediments exceeded pelagic biomass by factors of 6–22, and sedimentary bacterial production was 17–35 times higher than in the overlying water column. 5. On a square meter basis, total bacterial production in the Spree was clearly higher than primary productivity. Thus, the lowland river Spree is a heterotrophic system with benthic processes dominating. Therefore, sedimentary and epiphytic bacterial productivity form important components of ecosystem carbon metabolism in rivers and shallow lakes. 6. The sediments are focal sites of microbial degradation of organic carbon in a sand-bottomed lowland river. The presence of a lowland river section within a river continuum probably greatly changes the geochemical fluxes within the river network. This implies that current concepts of longitudinal biogeochemical relationships within river systems have to be revised.},

	abstract = {Biofouling is the undesired deposition and growth of microorganisms on surfaces, forming biofilms. The definition is subjective and operational: not every biofilm causes biofouling - only if a given a subjective “threshold of interference” is exceeded, biofilms cause technical or medical problems. These range from the formation of slime layers on ship hulls or in pipelines, which increase friction resistance, to separation membranes, on which biofilms increase hydraulic resistance, to heat exchangers where they interfere with heat transport to contamination of treated water by eroded biofilm cells which may comprise hygienically relevant microorganisms, and, most dangerous, to biofilms on implants and catheters which can cause persistent infections. The largest fraction of anti-fouling research, usually in short-term experiments, is focused on prevention or limiting primary microbial adhesion. Intuitively, this appears only logical, but turns out mostly hopeless. This is because in technical systems with open access for microorganisms, all surfaces are colonized sooner or later which explains the very limited success of that research. As a result, the use of biocides remains the major tool to fight persistent biofilms. However, this is costly in terms of biocides, it stresses working materials, causes off-time and environmental damage and it usually leaves large parts of biofilms in place, ready for regrowth. In order to really solve biofouling problems, it is necessary to learn how to live with biofilms and mitigate their detrimental effects. This requires rather an integrated strategy than aiming to invent “one-shot” solutions. In this context, it helps to understand the biofilm way of life as a natural phenomenon. Biofilms are the oldest, most successful and most widely distributed form of life on earth, existing even in extreme environments and being highly resilient. Microorganisms in biofilms live in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which allows them to develop emerging properties such as enhanced nutrient acquisition, synergistic microconsortia, enhanced tolerance to biocides and antibiotics, intense intercellular communication and cooperation. Transiently immobilized, biofilm organisms turn their matrix into an external digestion system by retaining complexed exoenzymes in the matrix. Biofilms grow even on traces of any biodegradable material, therefore, an effective anti-fouling strategy comprises to keep the system low in nutrients (good housekeeping), employing low-fouling, easy-to-clean surfaces, monitoring of biofilm development, allowing for early intervention, and acknowledging that cleaning can be more important than trying to kill biofilms, because cleaning does not cut the nutrient supply of survivors and dead biomass serves as an additional carbon source for “cannibalizing” survivors, supporting rapid after growth. An integrated concept is presented as the result of a long journey of the author through biofouling problems.},

Biofilms, and the resulting lifestyle, are built in specific, defined steps, producing a bacterial community that is heterogeneous in space and time.Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) immobilize biofilm cells, keeping them in long-term close proximity and, thus, allowing intense interactions to occur, including cell–cell communication, horizontal gene transfer and the formation of synergistic microconsortia.Owing to the retention of extracellular enzymes in the matrix, a versatile external digestive system is generated: dissolved and particulate nutrients imported through the water phase of the matrix can be sequestered, accumulated and utilized. The matrix acts as an ultimate recycling yard, keeping all the components of lysed cells available, including DNA, and possibly therefore serving as a large genetic archive. Gradient formation creates a wide range of very different habitats, contributing to biodiversity in biofilms.The matrix protects organisms in the biofilm from desiccation, biocides, antibiotics, heavy metals, ultraviolet radiation, host immune defences and many protozoan grazers.Eventually, EPS can serve as a nutrient source, but — as for many other structural polymers in biology — some EPS components are only slowly biodegradable. The vast variety of EPS components means that their complete degradation requires a wide range of enzymes.Ecologically, competition and cooperation in the confined space of the EPS matrix, and competition for the limited nutrients in particular, lead to constant adaptation of population fitness.},

	abstract = {Biofilms are a form of collective life with emergent properties that confer many advantages on their inhabitants, and they represent a much higher level of organization than single cells do. However, to date, no global analysis on biofilm abundance exists. We offer a critical discussion of the definition of biofilms and compile current estimates of global cell numbers in major microbial habitats, mindful of the associated uncertainty. Most bacteria and archaea on Earth (1.2 × 1030 cells) exist in the ‘big five’ habitats: deep oceanic subsurface (4 × 1029), upper oceanic sediment (5 × 1028), deep continental subsurface (3 × 1029), soil (3 × 1029) and oceans (1 × 1029). The remaining habitats, including groundwater, the atmosphere, the ocean surface microlayer, humans, animals and the phyllosphere, account for fewer cells by orders of magnitude. Biofilms dominate in all habitats on the surface of the Earth, except in the oceans, accounting for {\textasciitilde}80\% of bacterial and archaeal cells. In the deep subsurface, however, they cannot always be distinguished from single sessile cells; we estimate that 20–80\% of cells in the subsurface exist as biofilms. Hence, overall, 40–80\% of cells on Earth reside in biofilms. We conclude that biofilms drive all biogeochemical processes and represent the main way of active bacterial and archaeal life.},

For the coming decades, risks for downstream sites and stakeholders will persist, mainly due to secondary sources originating from historical pollution of soils and sediments in the catchment area. In practice, a catchment-wide assessment of historical contaminated soil and sediment should apply a three-step approach: (i) Identification of substances of concern (s.o.c.) and their classification into ’hazard classes of compounds’; (ii) identification of areas of concern (a.o.c.) and their classification into ‘hazard classes of sites’; (iii) identification of areas of risk (a.o.r.) and their assessment relative to each other with regard to the probability of polluting the sediments in the downstream reaches. The conversion of this concept has to consider the underlying philosophy of the EU Water Framework Directive, particularly with respect to the analysis and monitoring of priority substances in solid matrices. However, major deficiencies are still in the assessment and prognosis of resuspension processes, and potential approaches to fill this gap are described both in theory and from examples of the Elbe River.},

	abstract = {Objectives The marine benthic nitrogen cycle is affected by both the presence and activity of macrofauna and the diversity of N-cycling microbes. However, integrated research simultaneously investigating macrofauna, microbes and N-cycling is lacking. We investigated spatio-temporal patterns in microbial community composition and diversity, macrofaunal abundance and their sediment reworking activity, and N-cycling in seven subtidal stations in the Southern North Sea. Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the Microbial Communities Our results indicated that bacteria (total and β-AOB) showed more spatio-temporal variation than archaea (total and AOA) as sedimentation of organic matter and the subsequent changes in the environment had a stronger impact on their community composition and diversity indices in our study area. However, spatio-temporal patterns of total bacterial and β-AOB communities were different and related to the availability of ammonium for the autotrophic β-AOB. Highest bacterial richness and diversity were observed in June at the timing of the phytoplankton bloom deposition, while richness of β-AOB as well as AOA peaked in September. Total archaeal community showed no temporal variation in diversity indices. Macrofauna, Microbes and the Benthic N-Cycle Distance based linear models revealed that, independent from the effect of grain size and the quality and quantity of sediment organic matter, nitrification and N-mineralization were affected by respectively the diversity of metabolically active β-AOB and AOA, and the total bacteria, near the sediment-water interface. Separate models demonstrated a significant and independent effect of macrofaunal activities on community composition and richness of total bacteria, and diversity indices of metabolically active AOA. Diversity of β-AOB was significantly affected by macrofaunal abundance. Our results support the link between microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in marine sediments, and provided broad correlative support for the hypothesis that this relationship is modulated by macrofaunal activity. We hypothesized that the latter effect can be explained by their bioturbating and bio-irrigating activities, increasing the spatial complexity of the biogeochemical environment.},

This close physical relationship between the bacteria and algae was mediated by a network of fibers which, in mass, appeared as a layer of slime covering the streambed. The relationship between sessile bacterial concentratons and epilithic algal biomass in one tributary suggested that, in some cases, factors other than epilithic primary production governed the attached microbial population.},

	abstract = {In aquatic habitats, micro-organisms successfully adhere to and mediate particles, thus changing the erosive response of fine sediments to hydrodynamic forcing by secreting glue-like extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Because sediment dynamics is vital for many ecological and economic aspects of watersheds and coastal regions, biostabilization of cohesive sediments is one of the important ecosystem services provided by biofilms. Although the research on biostabilization has gained momentum over the last 20 years, we still have limited insights principally due to the complex nature of this topic, the varying spatial, temporal, and community scales examined, oversimplified ecohydraulic experiments with little natural relevance, and the often partial views of the disciplines involved. This review highlights the current state of our knowledge on biostabilization and identifies important areas for future research on: (A) the influence of abiotic conditions on initial colonization and subsequent biofilm growth, focusing on hydrodynamics, substratum, salinity, nutrition, and light climate; (B) the response of microbes in terms of physiological activity and species diversity to environmental settings as well as biotic conditions such as competition and grazing; and (C) the effects of the former on the EPS matrix, its main constituents, their composition, functional groups/substitutes, and structures/linkages. The review focuses specifically on how the numerous mutual feedback mechanisms between abiotic and biotic conditions influence microbial stabilization capacity, and thus cohesive sediment dynamics.},

	abstract = {Sediment stability is a critical component for the understanding of cohesive sediment dynamics. Traditionally, physico-chemical sediment conditions have been regarded as most important drivers of sediment stability. However, over the last decade, the stabilization of sediment by biological activity, particularly the influence of highly hydrated matrices of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) has been given increasing attention. However, most studies have focused on the sediment/water interface and, usually, of marine systems. The present study exploits current knowledge of EPS dynamics from marine systems and applies it to freshwater habitats, also considering a wide range of biological and physico-chemical variables. Natural sediments were taken from a freshwater site with high levels of heavy metal pollution (Lauffen reservoir, River Neckar, Germany). Vertical profiles from the flocculent surface layer to depth of 50 cm within the sediment were investigated, monthly, over the course of year. Tubificidae and Chironomidae larvae constituted the majority of the macrofauna. Despite the turbidity of the water column, a highly diverse and abundant microphytobenthic community of diatoms (11–82 µg g−1 DW) was found at the sediment surface closely associated with high numbers of bacteria (109 cells g−1 DW). The concentrations of all EPS moieties were remarkably high (0.1–0.5, 1.7–3.8, 0.9–5.2 mg g−1 DW, for colloidal and bound carbohydrates and proteins, respectively) and levels were comparable to those determined in intertidal studies. The microalgal and bacterial biomass both showed strong correlations with the colloidal and bound EPS carbohydrate fractions. The data suggested that the present macrofauna as well as the metabolic activities of microalgae and bacteria interact with sedimentological factors to influence the properties of the sediment by binding fine-grained sediment, changing water content and enhancing the organic content through secretion products. The colloidal and bound EPS moieties showed strong correlation with the critical shear stress for erosion over sediment depth. It is suggested that the cohesive strength of the sediment was controlled by a high number of active adsorption sites and higher charge densities in fine grained sediments. The EPS network may significantly enhance this by embedding particles and permeating the void space but also in offering additional ionic binding sites and cross-linkages.},

Despite the attention that these phenotypes have garnered, the bacterial systems used for sensing and responding to surfaces are still not well understood. An understanding of these mechanisms will guide the development of new classes of materials that inhibit and promote cell growth, and complement studies of the physiology of bacteria in contact with surfaces. Recent studies from a range of fields in science and engineering are poised to guide future investigations in this area.

Seven global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2 K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean temperatures.

Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola-Flint-Chattahoochee River basins' water usage has evolved from power generation to multiple uses. Recreation and housing have become increasingly valuable components. Changing use patterns imply changing resource values. This study focused on six Alabama reservoirs, using contingent valuation questions in on-site, telephone, and mail surveys to estimate impacts on lakefront property values, recreational expenditures, and preservation values for scenarios of permanent changes to reservoir water quantity. As summer full-pool duration decreased, lakefront property value decreased, and as duration increased, property values increased, but at a lesser rate. Similar findings occurred for winter draw down alternatives. Permanent one-foot reductions in summer full-pool water levels resulted in a 4 to 15 percent decrease in lakefront property values. Recreational expenditures decreased 4 to 30 percent for each one-foot lowering of reservoir water levels. Current nonusers of the six reservoirs showed strong preferences for protecting study reservoirs with willingness to pay values of 47 per household or approximately 29 million for the entire six-reservoir watershed basin area. Resource management based on historic use patterns may be inappropriate and more frequent and comprehensive valuation of reservoir resources is needed.},

	abstract = {Sedimentation processes are in a „dynamic balance“ in most natural rivers, but the construction of dams and reservoirs influences these natural conditions. The flow velocities, turbulences and bed shear stresses in reservoirs are reduced compared to free flow conditions, which lead to the deposition of the transported sediment particles. As a further consequence the sediment depositions reduce the storage volume by ``filling up" the reservoir. This ``reservoir sedimentation" is a problem in many Alpine reservoirs.
This thesis focus on the sediment deposition problems and the sediment transport processes in reservoirs of river power plants with a small storage volume compared to the annual inflow. The aims are the improvement of the sediment management in Alpine reservoirs and the analysis of the effect of sediment deposition in reservoirs on the operation of the reservoir and the flood protection of the surrounding area. This aims require the knowledge of sedimentation, erosion and sediment transport processes together with field measurements and an adequate model to assess the impact of the selected sediment management method. 
Two different three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic programs were used to simulate the sediment transport processes and effects during flushing and flood events in two Alpine river reservoirs. The results of the simulations were calibrated and validated with measurements conducted in the prototype or in the physical model test. Several sediment transport algorithm were tested and validated with the measured bed changes. The simulated bed changes and sediment transport processes showed a good correlation with the measurements. The effects of sediment depositions and the remobilization of deposited sediment in reservoirs could be analysed. Based on the results of the numerical modelling it is possible to recommend sediment management strategies for small Alpine reservoirs.},

However, effects of such fluctuations on CH4 emissions have received limited attention. Here we examine CH4 emission dynamics in six Pacific Northwest U.S. reservoirs of varying trophic status, morphometry, and management regimes. In these systems, we show that water-level drawdowns can, at least temporarily, greatly increase per-area reservoir CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, and can account for more than 90\% of annual reservoir CH4 flux in a period of just a few weeks. Reservoirs with higher epilimnetic [chlorophyll a] experienced larger increases in CH4 emission in response to drawdown (R2 = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that eutrophication magnifies the effect of drawdown on CH4 emission. We show that drawdowns as small as 0.5 m can stimulate ebullition events. Given that drawdown events of this magnitude are quite common in reservoirs, our results suggest that this process must be considered in sampling strategies designed to characterize total CH4 fluxes from reservoirs. The extent to which (and the mechanisms by which) drawdowns short-circuit connections between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, thereby increasing net CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, should be a focus of future work.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional numerical model SSIIM was used to compute suspended sediment distribution and deposition pattern in a hydropower reservoir. The study also included three-dimensional measurements of suspended sediments in the reservoir using the LISST-SL instrument. The measurement device is based on a laser-diffraction method and measures concentrations and grain size distributions instantly. It was applied to 25 locations in the reservoir where vertical profiles were taken. The measurements and computed results were compared and reasonable agreement was found. In addition, computed bed elevation changes were compared with measured values in the conducted study. The results of the numerical model agree well with the bed levels taken by echo sounding. The numerical model SSIIM solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations in three dimensions and uses an adaptive grid which moves in accordance to changes in the water and bed levels. The suspended sediment transport is calculated by solving the convection–diffusion equation and the bed load transport by an empirical formula. The used implicit free-water surface algorithm provides the possibility of using large time step sizes, which makes a simulation of an operation year on a desktop PC possible.},

	abstract = {The ability of hydropower to contribute to climate change mitigation is sometimes questioned, citing emissions of methane and carbon dioxide resulting from the degradation of biogenic carbon in hydropower reservoirs. These emissions are, however, not always addressed in life cycle assessment, leading to a bias in technology comparisons, and often misunderstood. The objective of this paper is to review and analyze the generation of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs for the purpose of technology assessment, relating established emission measurements to power generation. A literature review, data collection, and statistical analysis of methane and CO2 emissions are conducted. In a sample of 82 measurements, methane emissions per kWh hydropower generated are log-normally distributed, ranging from micrograms to 10s of kg. A multivariate regression analysis shows that the reservoir area per kWh electricity is the most important explanatory variable. Methane emissions flux per reservoir area are correlated with the natural net primary production of the area, the age of the power plant, and the inclusion of bubbling emissions in the measurement. Even together, these factors fail to explain most of the variation in the methane flux. The global average emissions from hydropower are estimated to be 85 gCO2/kWh and 3 gCH4/kWh, with a multiplicative uncertainty factor of 2. GHG emissions from hydropower can be largely avoided by ceasing to build hydropower plants with high land use per unit of electricity generated.},

Traditionally, the referred study has largely been devoted to forming mechanism, influencing factors and physicochemical sediment conditions of all kinds of organic-flocculation and inorganic-flocculation. However, during the last decade, the bioflocculation of sediment by biological activity has been given increasing attention. But most studies have focused on the interrelations between biological and sedimentological variables. With the assistance of a newly developed field kit and correlative microscopy (which includes environmental scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy), this article begins to bridge the resolution gap between sediment particles and biological activities as well as its metabolic products biofilm, in order to better understand the role of polymeric material biofilm in floc ultrastructure and outward floc behavior of bioflocculation sediment. Results have demonstrated that bioflocculation sediment was observed to be composed of complex networks of biofilm and appeared to be of complicated physical floc structures. The biofilm was found to embed particles and permeate the void space, representing the dominant physical bridging mechanism of the flocs and contributed to the extensive surface area, architecture characteristics, and mechanical properties of bioflocculation sediment.

	abstract = {Toxic cyanobacteria became more widely recognized as a potential health hazard in the 1990s, and in 1998 the World Health Organization (WHO) first published a provisional Guideline Value of 1μgL−1 for microcystin-LR in drinking-water. In this publication we compare risk assessment and risk management of toxic cyanobacteria in 17 countries across all five continents. We focus on the three main (oral) exposure vehicles to cyanotoxins: drinking-water, water related recreational and freshwater seafood. Most countries have implemented the provisional WHO Guideline Value, some as legally binding standard, to ensure the distribution of safe drinking-water with respect to microcystins. Regulation, however, also needs to address the possible presence of a wide range of other cyanotoxins and bioactive compounds, for which no guideline values can be derived due to insufficient toxicological data. The presence of microcystins (commonly expressed as microcystin-LR equivalents) may be used as proxy for overall guidance on risk management, but this simplification may miss certain risks, for instance from dissolved fractions of cylindrospermopsin and cyanobacterial neurotoxins. An alternative approach, often taken for risk assessment and management in recreational waters, is to regulate cyanobacterial presence – as cell numbers or biomass – rather than individual toxins. Here, many countries have implemented a two or three tier alert level system with incremental severity. These systems define the levels where responses are switched from Surveillance to Alert and finally to Action Mode and they specify the short-term actions that follow. Surface bloom formation is commonly judged to be a significant risk because of the elevated concentration of microcystins in a scum. Countries have based their derivations of legally binding standards, guideline values, maximally allowed concentrations (or limits named otherwise) on very similar scientific methodology, but underlying assumptions such as bloom duration, average body size and the amount of water consumed while swimming vary according to local circumstances. Furthermore, for toxins with incomplete toxicological data elements of expert judgment become more relevant and this also leads to a larger degree of variation between countries’ thresholds triggering certain actions. Cyanobacterial blooms and their cyanotoxin content are a highly variable phenomenon, largely depending on local conditions, and likely concentrations can be assessed and managed best if the specific conditions of the locality are known and their impact on bloom occurrence are understood. Risk Management Frameworks, such as for example the Water Safety Plan concept of the WHO and the ‘bathing water profile’ of the European Union are suggested to be effective approaches for preventing human exposure by managing toxic cyanobacteria from catchment to consumer for drinking water and at recreational sites.},

For this purpose, we have systematically analyzed and aggregated 27 frameworks employed by academics analyzing dams' social impacts (found in a set of 217 articles). A key finding of the analysis is that currently used frameworks are often not specific to dams and thus omit key impacts associated with them. The result of our analysis and aggregation is a new framework for scholarly analysis (which we call ‘matrix framework’) specifically on dams' social impacts, with space, time and value as its key dimensions as well as infrastructure, community and livelihood as its key components. Building on the scholarly understanding of this topic enables us to conceptualize the inherently complex and multidimensional issues of dams' social impacts in a holistic manner. If commonly employed in academia (and possibly in practice), this framework would enable more transparent assessment and comparison of projects.},

All articles were assessed against an aggregate matrix framework on the social impact of dams, which combines 27 existing frameworks. We find that existing literature is highly biased with regard to: perspective (45\% negative versus 5\% positive); dam size (large dams are overrepresented); spatial focus (on the resettlement area); and temporal focus (5–10years ex-post resettlement). Additionally, there is bias in terms of whose views are included, with those of dam developers rarely examined by scholars.

The increasing numbers of geese are causing problems in tourism and agriculture. The number of resident greylag geese visiting the Altmuehlsee lake, a recreational area in the south of Germany, has also increased, especially in June and July. However, the geese leave the lake again at the beginning of August. 30 adult greylag geese were banded with telemetry transmitters during molting at the Altmuehlsee lake to determine when the geese leave the lake in August and what structures they need in their winter habitat. The distances the greylag geese flew from their resting sites to foraging sites were calculated, as well as the size of their home ranges and the proportions of each habitat type in the home range. It was found that the greylag geese used small home ranges while rearing their young, and fed close to the water. After molting, the size of their home ranges increased. They fed on fields and meadows around the lake. In the winter habitat, the geese also had a small home range, and they preferred eating grain and corn and the availability of an open body of water. In addition, one group of geese remained in the city of Munich during the winter, benefiting from supplementary food from people. This information helps us to understand the different requirements of resident greylag geese. It can be used to inform management decisions aimed at preventing agricultural damage. Special goose areas can for example be designated for the different periods in a goose’s life cycle.},

	abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

	abstract = {Controversy surrounds the green credentials of hydroelectricity because of the potentially large emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from associated reservoirs. However, limited and patchy data particularly for China is constraining the current global assessment of GHG releases from hydroelectric reservoirs. This study provides the first evaluation of the CO2 and CH4 emissions from China’s hydroelectric reservoirs by considering the reservoir water surface and drawdown areas, and downstream sources (including spillways and turbines, as well as river downstream). The total emission of 29.6 Tg CO2/year and 0.47 Tg CH4/year from hydroelectric reservoirs in China, expressed as CO2 equivalents (eq), corresponds to 45.6 Tg CO2eq/year, which is 2-fold higher than the current GHG emission (ca. 23 Tg CO2eq/year) from global temperate hydropower reservoirs. China’s average emission of 70 g CO2eq/kWh from hydropower amounts to 7 \% of the emissions from coal-fired plant alternatives. China’s hydroelectric reservoirs thus currently mitigate GHG emission when compared to the main alternative source of electricity with potentially far great reductions in GHG emissions and benefits possible through relatively minor changes to reservoir management and design. On average, the sum of drawdown and downstream emission including river reaches below dams and turbines, which is overlooked by most studies, represents the equivalent of 42 \% of the CO2 and 92 \% of CH4 that emit from hydroelectric reservoirs in China. Main drivers on GHG emission rates are summarized and highlight that water depth and stratification control CH4 flux, and CO2 flux shows significant negative relationships with pH, DO, and Chl-a. Based on our finding, a substantial revision of the global carbon emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs is warranted.},

We present a compilation of the CO$_{\textrm{2}}$, CO, CH$_{\textrm{4}}$ and N$_{\textrm{2}}$O balances of Europe following a dual constraint approach in which (1) a land-based balance derived mainly from ecosystem carbon inventories and (2) a land-based balance derived from flux measurements are compared to (3) the atmospheric data-based balance derived from inversions constrained by measurements of atmospheric GHG (greenhouse gas) concentrations. Good agreement between the GHG balances based on fluxes (1294 ± 545 Tg C in CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-eq yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), inventories (1299 ± 200 Tg C in CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-eq yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) and inversions (1210 ± 405 Tg C in CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-eq yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) increases our confidence that the processes underlying the European GHG budget are well understood and reasonably sampled. However, the uncertainty remains large and largely lacks formal estimates. Given that European net land to atmosphere exchanges are determined by a few dominant fluxes, the uncertainty of these key components needs to be formally estimated before efforts could be made to reduce the overall uncertainty. The net land-to-atmosphere flux is a net source for CO$_{\textrm{2}}$, CO, CH$_{\textrm{4}}$ and N$_{\textrm{2}}$O, because the anthropogenic emissions by far exceed the biogenic sink strength. The dual-constraint approach confirmed that the European biogenic sink removes as much as 205 ± 72 Tg C yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$ from fossil fuel burning from the atmosphere. However, This C is being sequestered in both terrestrial and inland aquatic ecosystems. If the C-cost for ecosystem management is taken into account, the net uptake of ecosystems is estimated to decrease by 45\% but still indicates substantial C-sequestration. However, when the balance is extended from CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ towards the main GHGs, C-uptake by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is offset by emissions of non-CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ GHGs. As such, the European ecosystems are unlikely to contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Inland waters transport and transform substantial amounts of carbon and account for ∼18\% of global methane emissions. Large reservoirs with higher areal methane release rates than natural waters contribute significantly to freshwater emissions. However, there are millions of small dams worldwide that receive and trap high loads of organic carbon and can therefore potentially emit significant amounts of methane to the atmosphere. We evaluated the effect of damming on methane emissions in a central European impounded river. Direct comparison of riverine and reservoir reaches, where sedimentation in the latter is increased due to trapping by dams, revealed that the reservoir reaches are the major source of methane emissions (∼0.23 mmol CH4 m–2 d–1 vs ∼19.7 mmol CH4 m–2 d–1, respectively) and that areal emission rates far exceed previous estimates for temperate reservoirs or rivers. We show that sediment accumulation correlates with methane production and subsequent ebullitive release rates and may therefore be an excellent proxy for estimating methane emissions from small reservoirs. Our results suggest that sedimentation-driven methane emissions from dammed river hot spot sites can potentially increase global freshwater emissions by up to 7\%.},

A large fraction of the methane emitted from freshwaters is transported via ebullition. However, due to its strong variability in space and time, accurate measurements of ebullition rates are difficult; hence, the uncertainty regarding its contribution to global budgets is large. Here, we analyze measurements made by continuously recording automated bubble traps in an impounded river in central Europe and investigate the mechanisms affecting the temporal dynamics of bubble release from cohesive sediments. Our results show that the main triggers of bubble release were pressure changes, originating from the passage of ship lock-induced surges and ship passages. The response to physical forcing was also affected by previous outgassing. Ebullition rates varied strongly over all relevant timescales from minutes to days; therefore, representative ebullition estimates could only be inferred with continuous sampling over long periods. Since ebullition was found to be episodic, short-term measurement periods of a few hours or days will likely underestimate ebullition rates. Our results thus indicate that flux estimates could be grossly underestimated (by up to {\textasciitilde}50\%) if the correct temporal resolution is not used during data collection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Sediment fluxes in aquatic environments are crucially dependent on bedform dynamics. However, sediment-flux predictions rely almost completely on clean-sand studies, despite most environments being composed of mixtures of non-cohesive sands, physically cohesive muds and biologically cohesive extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) generated by microorganisms. EPS associated with surficial biofilms are known to stabilize sediment and increase erosion thresholds. Here we present experimental data showing that the pervasive distribution of low levels of EPS throughout the sediment, rather than the high surficial levels of EPS in biofilms, is the key control on bedform dynamics. The development time for bedforms increases by up to two orders of magnitude for extremely small quantities of pervasively distributed EPS. This effect is far stronger than for physical cohesion, because EPS inhibit sand grains from moving independently. The results highlight that present bedform predictors are overly simplistic, and the associated sediment transport processes require re-assessment for the influence of EPS., 
The role of cohesion is vital to our understanding of how sedimentary bedforms evolve. Here, the authors show that microorganisms within the sediment affect cohesion and demonstrate that ripples can take up to one hundred times as long to develop when extracellular polymeric substances are present.},

Other factors controlling sediment discharge (e.g., climate, runoff) appear to have secondary importance. A notable exception is the influence of human activity, climate, and geology on the rivers draining southern Asia and Oceania. Sediment fluxes from small mountainous rivers, many of which discharge directly onto active margins (e.g., western South and North America and most high-standing oceanic islands), have been greatly underestimated in previous global sediment budgets, perhaps by as much as a factor of three. In contrast, sediment fluxes to the ocean from large rivers (nearly all of which discharge onto passive margins or marginal seas) have been overestimated, as some of the sediment load is subaerially sequestered in subsiding deltas. Before the proliferation of dam construction in the latter half of this century, rivers probably discharged about 20 billion tons of sediment annually to the ocean. Prior to widespread farming and deforestation (beginning 2000-2500 yr ago), however, sediment discharge probably was less than half the present level. Sediments discharged by small mountainous rivers are more likely to escape to the deep sea during high stands of sea level by virtue of a greater impact of episodic events (i.e., flash floods and earthquakes) on small drainage basins and because of the narrow shelves associated with active margins. The resulting delta/fan deposits can be distinctly different than the sedimentary deposits derived from larger rivers that discharge onto passive margins.},

(1) Background: The two-fold aim was to develop solutions to the impacts of resettlement on natural and social capital, and strategies for timely intervention and new livelihoods after households were resettled. (2) Methods: Livelihood survey of all 46 households was conducted in 2010, and villagers were asked about 2004, before resettlement, and about 2009, when the occupants of Bo Hon village had been moved to a new location 15 km away from the original one. The research employed mixed-methods by using household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The impacts of displacement and resettlement on production activities and daily life of rural people were examined in the following areas: (i) land resource; (ii) access to common-pool natural resources; (iii) income structure; (iv) agriculturally based livelihoods; (v) material assets; (vi) customary practices; and (vii) social relationships. (3) Results: The most significant impact was on the type of production activities that could be conducted after resettlement and reduction in land area to grow profitable commodities such as Lồ Ô Bamboo. Specifically, land for growing rice and other crops were significantly affected with the land area substantially reduced or flooded. Also harvesting of common pool resources from the forest (NTFPs) were reduced such as honey and rattan, and only 25\% of the villagers continued to fish in the river. (4) Conclusions: Strategies were put in place to reduce the level of disruption to the villagers’ livelihoods, but some parts of the compensation package were short-lived or inequitably distributed (e.g., land), while infrastructure developments such as sealed roads have made the village far more accessible to Hue City some 25 km away.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the most ancient phytoplankton on the planet and form harmful algal blooms in freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Recent research suggests that eutrophication and climate change are two processes that may promote the proliferation and expansion of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. In this review, we specifically examine the relationships between eutrophication, climate change and representative cyanobacterial genera from freshwater (Microcystis, Anabaena, Cylindrospermopsis), estuarine (Nodularia, Aphanizomenon), and marine ecosystems (Lyngbya, Synechococcus, Trichodesmium). Commonalities among cyanobacterial genera include being highly competitive for low concentrations of inorganic P (DIP) and the ability to acquire organic P compounds. Both diazotrophic (= nitrogen (N2) fixers) and non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria display great flexibility in the N sources they exploit to form blooms. Hence, while some cyanobacterial blooms are associated with eutrophication, several form blooms when concentrations of inorganic N and P are low. Cyanobacteria dominate phytoplankton assemblages under higher temperatures due to both physiological (e.g. more rapid growth) and physical factors (e.g. enhanced stratification), with individual species showing different temperature optima. Significantly less is known regarding how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will affect cyanobacteria, although some evidence suggests several genera of cyanobacteria are well-suited to bloom under low concentrations of CO2. While the interactive effects of future eutrophication and climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms are complex, much of the current knowledge suggests these processes are likely to enhance the magnitude and frequency of these events.},

Hydroelectric reservoirs are anthropogenic aquatic systems that occur across a wide geographical extent, and, in addition to their importance for energy production, they have the potential to release two important greenhouse gases (GHGs), carbon dioxide and methane. We report results from an extensive study of eight hydroelectric reservoirs located in central and southeastern tropical Brazil. In the Brazilian dry tropical biome reservoirs, emissions (in tons of CO2 Eq. per MWh) varied from 0.01 to 0.55, and decreased with reservoir age. Total emissions were higher in the reservoir lake when compared to the river downstream the dam; however, emissions per unit area, in the first kilometer of the river after the dam, were higher than that in the reservoir. The results showed, despite higher carbon emissions per energy production in the youngest reservoirs, lower emission from hydroelectric reservoirs from the studied region in relation to thermo electrical supply, fueled by coal or fossil fuel. The ratio emission of GHG per MWh produced is an important parameter in evaluating the service provided by hydroelectric reservoir and for energy planning policies.},

	abstract = {Mitigating the global expansion of cyanobacterial harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) is a major challenge facing researchers and resource managers. A variety of traditional (e.g., nutrient load reduction) and experimental (e.g., artificial mixing and flushing, omnivorous fish removal) approaches have been used to reduce bloom occurrences. Managers now face the additional effects of climate change on watershed hydrologic and nutrient loading dynamics, lake and estuary temperature, mixing regime, internal nutrient dynamics, and other factors. Those changes favor CyanoHABs over other phytoplankton and could influence the efficacy of control measures. Virtually all mitigation strategies are influenced by climate changes, which may require setting new nutrient input reduction targets and establishing nutrient-bloom thresholds for impacted waters. Physical-forcing mitigation techniques, such as flushing and artificial mixing, will need adjustments to deal with the ramifications of climate change. Here, we examine the suite of current mitigation strategies and the potential options for adapting and optimizing them in a world facing increasing human population pressure and climate change.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the Earth’s oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history (∼3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.},

	abstract = {The importance of facilitative interactions and organismal ecosystem engineering for establishing the structure of communities is increasingly being recognised for many different ecosystems. For example, soft-bottom tidal flats host a wide range of ecosystem engineers, probably because the harsh physico-chemical environmental conditions render these species of particular importance for community structure and function. These environments are therefore interesting when focusing on how ecosystem engineers interact and the consequences of these interactions on community dynamics. In this review, we initially detail the influence on benthic systems of two kinds of ecosystem engineers that are particularly common in tidal flats. Firstly, we examine species providing biogenic structures, which are often the only source of habitat complexity in these environments. Secondly, we focus on species whose activities alter sediment stability, which is a crucial feature structuring the dynamics of communities in tidal flats. The impacts of these engineers on both environment and communities were assessed but in addition the interaction between ecosystem engineers was examined. Habitat cascades occur when one engineer favours the development of another, which in turn creates or modifies and improves habitat for other species. Non-hierarchical interactions have often been shown to display non-additive effects, so that the effects of the association cannot be predicted from the effects of individual organisms. Here we propose the term of “cooperative ecosystem engineering” when two species interact in a way which enhances habitat suitability as a result of a combined engineering effect. Finally, we conclude by describing the potential threats for ecosystem engineers in intertidal areas, potential effects on their interactions and their influence on communities and ecosystem function.},

In this study, we focus on long-term time series of particle-bound hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and selected polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-138 and PCB-153) that were monitored biweekly to monthly at eight stations in the River Rhine catchment. Our aims are (1) to detect trends in the concentration series HCB, PCB-138 and PCB-153, (2) to estimate the uncertainty of loads caused by SM collection techniques and load calculation procedures and (3) to detect trends in the subsequently calculated annual load series. HCB concentration in the SM for the period 1995–2008 significantly (p {\textless} 0·01) decreased at six of the eight monitoring stations. Decreasing PCB-138 and PCB-153 concentrations are significant at six of the eight and seven of the eight monitoring stations, respectively. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that tested the effect of two collection techniques and four load calculation procedures on annual loads indicates homogeneity of the methods at four of the five monitoring stations. At Weil, only the loads of HCB, PCB-138 and PCB-153 are significantly affected by the collection technique. The trend analysis of an extended series (1985–2007) of annual HCB loads at Koblenz showed a significant decrease from about 110 kg year−1 to about 15–23 kg year−1; however, in the shorter period (1995–2007) only at two of the eight monitoring stations decreasing trends of annual contaminant load could be detected. We conclude that any of the tested load calculation procedures can be applied, as loads do no differ systematically. Although a high uncertainty in load estimation exists (e.g. maximum percentage error of E = [18·1, 122·5]\% for HCB), the monitoring programme at the Rhine is adequate for analysing the long-term chemical status of SM.

	abstract = {Benthic cyanobacteria are found globally in plethora of environments. Although they have received less attention than their planktonic freshwater counterparts, it is now well established that they produce toxins and reports of their involvement in animal poisonings have increased markedly during the last decade. Most of the known cyanotoxins have been identified from benthic cyanobacteria including: the hepatotoxic microcystins, nodularins and cylindrospermopsins, the neurotoxic saxitoxins, anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a and dermatotoxins, such as lyngbyatoxin. In most countries, observations of toxic benthic cyanobacteria are fragmented, descriptive and in response to animal toxicosis events. Only a limited number of long-term studies have aimed to understand why benthic proliferations occur, and/or how toxin production is regulated. These studies have shown that benthic cyanobacterial blooms are commonly a mixture of toxic and non-toxic genotypes and that toxin concentrations can be highly variable spatially and temporally. Physiochemical parameters responsible for benthic proliferation vary among habitat type with physical disturbance (e.g., flow regimes, wave action) and nutrients commonly identified as important. As climatic conditions change and anthropogenic pressures on waterways increase, it seems likely that the prevalence of blooms of benthic cyanobacteria will increase. In this article we review current knowledge on benthic cyanobacteria: ecology, toxin-producing species, variables that regulate toxin production and bloom formation, their impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms and current monitoring and management strategies. We suggest research needs that will assist in filling knowledge gaps and ultimately allow more robust monitoring and management protocols to be developed.},

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr−1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr−1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

Starting from momentum balance considerations on a single sediment floc, the Shields dimensionless mobility parameter in incipient motion conditions is expressed also as a function of both cohesive and adhesive forces that concur to stabilize the superficial layer of the benthic sediment. The entrainment model is validated on the basis of laboratory experiments carried out on natural benthic sediments sampled from three alpine Italian lakes, having different trophic conditions and different compositions of the bed. The experimental results show that the cohesive effects decrease as the sediment water content increases. Moreover the role of bioadhesion is experimentally evaluated: the critical shear stresses of ‘living’ sediments are higher than that measured on similar but ‘dead’, poisoned sediments. This stabilizing effect shows a variation in time on a seasonal time scale, accordingly to the literature indications where biological adhesion is related to phytoplankton and bacteria activity, the life and growth of which obviously depends on seasonal variations.

	abstract = {1. In natural lakes, modifications in the species composition and abundance of phytoplankton communities may ultimately be responses to changes in nutrient availability and climatic fluctuations. Phytoplankton and associated environmental factors were collected at monthly intervals from the beginning of the 1990s to 2007 in the large subalpine Lake Garda (zmax = 350 m, V = 49 × 109 m3). In this study period, the lake showed a slight and continuous increase of total phosphorus (TP) in the water column, up to concentrations of 18–20 μg P L−1. This increase represented the last stage of a long-term process of enrichment documented since the 1970s, when concentrations of TP were below or around 10 μg P L−1. 2. At the community level, annual phytoplankton cycles underwent a unidirectional and slow shift mainly due to changes in the species more affected by the nutrient enrichment of the lake. After a first and long period of dominance by conjugatophytes (Mougeotia) and diatoms (Fragilaria), phytoplankton biomass in recent years was sustained by cyanobacteria (Planktothrix). Other important modifications in the development of phytoplankton were superimposed on this pattern due to the effects of annual climate fluctuations principally mediated by the deep mixing events at spring overturn and, secondarily, by temperature and thermal stability of the water column during the growing season. 3. Interannual variations in the stability and temperature of the water column appeared to influence the development of a few subdominant flagellates (dinophytes and cryptophytes). Nevertheless, the major impact of climate on phytoplankton was indirect, and mediated through the effects of winter climatic conditions on deep mixing dynamics. Winter climatic fluctuations proved to be a key element in a linked chain of causal factors including cooling of hypolimnetic waters, deep vertical mixing and epilimnetic nutrient replenishment. The process of fertilisation was measurable both for TP and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, although only the first had a large effect, reinforcing the seasonal growth of a few dominant groups. The degree of nutrient replenishment further increased the spring development of large diatoms and the increase of Planktothrix in summer and autumn. 4. Currently, changes in nutrient concentrations have the greatest effect on the phytoplankton community, while direct effects due to the interannual variations in the thermal regime are of secondary importance compared with the indirect effects mediated through deep water mixing and spring fertilisation. Overall, the results demonstrate that the consequences of climatic fluctuations and climate warming on phytoplankton communities need to be studied at different levels of complexity and integration, from the direct effects of temperature and thermal regime, to the indirect effects mediated by the physiographic characteristics of water bodies.},

	abstract = {This work investigated the combined effects of nutrient availability and temperature on phytoplankton in large and deep lakes south of the Alps (lakes Garda, Iseo, Como, Lugano and Maggiore). The more eutrophic basins (Lugano and Iseo) showed a higher presence of cyanobacteria, green algae (Chlorophyta and Charophyta) and dinoflagellates (Dinophyta). Besides these two water bodies, high biomasses of cyanobacteria were recorded also in the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Garda. The development of these algal groups during the growing season showed a strong dependence on the surface spring availability of SRP, which, in turn, was related to winter climatic oscillations, deep mixing dynamics, and trophic status. A specific analysis carried out by applying additive mixed modelling, generalized least squares and mixed modelling, allowed investigation of the direct, seasonal effects of water temperature variations and trophic status on different algal groups. The dominant cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) showed only a partial relationship with temperature, while Nostocales and Chroococcales, which did not appear to have a close relationship with the trophic status of the lakes, were characterised by abrupt increases during the warmer months. High positive relationships with temperature were found for a few other algal groups (e.g., Chlorophyta, Charophyta and Dinophyta). Overall, the results indicated a positive relationship between the seasonal development of the more abundant and eutrophic-sensitive algal groups and the concurrent effect of trophic status and water temperature. Nevertheless, it was stressed that specific differences could be interpreted taking into account the different autoecological characteristics and susceptibilities of different species and functional groups to other stressing factors favouring losses, including, e.g., vertical sinking and grazing.},

	abstract = {Nutrient inputs to lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and continental shelf waters are often dominated by nutrient release from sediments. Rates of nutrient release from the decomposition of sedimentary organic matter are determined by bacterial demands for food and energy. This dependence of decomposition kinetics on bacterial dynamics, however, is not explicitly considered in current models of early diagenesis. Here, we present a new model of early diagenesis that is based on soil decomposition models and that explicitly includes bacterial biomass as a state variable. Using the new model, we perform steady-state sensitivity analyses and integrate two time-dependent scenarios to determine the major controls on the abundance of bacteria in sediments and on sediment nutrient release. First, we test the sensitivity of bacterial biomass and nutrient release to substrate quantity and quality, and to bacterial growth parameters, growth efficiency and mortality. The model predicts that bacterial abundance in the sediments and nutrient release rates increase significantly with higher substrate inputs and higher quality of organic substrate. High growth efficiencies, on the other hand, reduce nutrient release rates and lead to more nutrient immobilization into bacterial biomass. Efficiency driven increases in bacterial abundances must be counteracted by higher mortality rates, if bacterial pool sizes are to remain within the range of values reported in the literature. Second, we simulate eutrophication and lake recovery over a 20-year period and the effect of a short-term peak in substrate input from an algal bloom. The model predicts that nutrient immobilization in the bacterial pool during eutrophication reduces nutrient release, while the decline of bacterial biomass in response to reduced substrate loadings prolongs lake recovery. The model further suggests that bacterial dynamics dampen the response of nutrient release to short-term peak inputs of organic matter. When bacterial biomass is allowed to vary over time, nutrient release rates are suppressed at their peak but remain elevated for a longer time. Models that do not consider the role of bacterial growth dynamics for organic matter decomposition are not able to simulate the potentially important effects of nutrient immobilization and variable decomposition rates on nutrient release.},

	abstract = {Sediment particles are often colonized by biofilm in a natural aquatic ecological system, especially in eutrophic water body. A series of laboratory experiments on particle size gradation, drag coefficient and settling velocity were conducted after natural sediment was colonized by biofilm for 5, 10, 15 and 20 days. Particle image acquisition, particle tracking techniques of Particle Image Velocimetry and Particle Tracking Velocimetry were utilized to analyze the changes of these properties. The experimental results indicate that the size gradation, the drag force exerted on bio-particles, and the settling velocity of bio-particles underwent significant change due to the growth of biofilm onto the sediment surface. The study proposes a characteristic particle size formula and a bio-particle settling velocity formula based on the regression of experiment results, that the settling velocity is only 50\% to 60\% as the single particle which has the same diameter and density. However, biofilm growth causes large particle which the settling velocities are approximately 10 times larger than that of primary particles. These results may be specifically used in the low energy reservoir or lake environment.},

	abstract = {Over a billion people around the world lack access to safe drinking water and over two billion have little or no sanitation. Do we have the resources — and the will — to provide the water to support a booming population? This issue of Nature (see introduction, p. 269 and Editorial, p. 253) tackles the science, economics and politics of the global water crisis. Climate scientists say that unreliable rains and drier summer soils will become more common: Quirin Schiermeier reports on water strategies for a drier world. The pressure is on farmers to get maximum crop yields with minimum water use. As Emma Marris reports, the collaboration between plant breeders, agronomists and geneticists to that end has been far from smooth. As the population of India grows, the demand for water keeps rising. Daemon Fairless investigates an ambitious plan to redistribute the country's water supplies by linking rivers in a vast canal network. Jamie Bartram says it is time to improve the global targets for access to water and sanitation to make them relevant to all. In most countries, crop irrigation accounts for most freshwater use — more than drinking water and domestic consumption — but water use in energy production is catching up fast. Mike Hightower and Suzanne Pierce describe the measures being developed to economize on water use in the energy sector. The need for research into water purification is pressing. In an extensive Review Article, Mark Shannon et al. highlight the developing technologies that — it is hoped — can provide our drinking water in the decades ahead. Water is (almost) everywhere, yet physicists still trade theory and counter theory to explain its structure: Phil Ball explains. And Books \& Arts looks at a documentary on water security, and at art inspired by water's surprising patterns. Go to http://www.nature.com/news/specials/water/index.htmlfor the on-line start-page.},

Damming of the river has resulted in the build-up of highly methanogenic sediments under a shallow water column, facilitating the transformation of fixed CO2 to atmospheric CH4. Similar high OC burial and CH4 ebullition is expected in other reservoirs and natural river deltas.},

Within these communities metabolic activities are integrated, and developmental sequences, not unlike those of multicellular organisms, can be detected. These structural adaptations and interrelationships are made possible by the expression of sets of genes that result in phenotypes that differ profoundly from those of planktonically grown cells of the same species. Molecular and microscopic evidence suggest the existence of a succession of de facto biofilm phenotypes. We submit that complex cell-cell interactions within prokaryotic communities are an ancient characteristic, the development of which was facilitated by the localization of cells at surfaces. In addition to spatial localization, surfaces may have provided the protective niche in which attached cells could create a localized homeostatic environment. In a holistic sense both biofilm and planktonic phenotypes may be viewed as integrated components of prokaryote life.},

Over 100 billion metric tons of sediment and 1 to 3 billion metric tons of carbon are now sequestered in reservoirs constructed largely within the past 50 years.

We use a high-temporal resolution data set of ebullitive fluxes from the eutrophic Upper Mystic Lake, Massachusetts to understand the triggers that lead to bubbling from submerged sediments. A wavelet approach is introduced to detect ebullition events for multiple time-scales, and is complemented with traditional statistical methods for data analyses. We show that bubble release from lake sediments occurred synchronously at several sites, and was closely associated with small, aperiodic drops in total hydrostatic pressure. Such results are essential to constrain mechanistic models and to design future measurement schemes, particularly with respect to the temporal scales that are needed to accurately observe and quantify ebullition in aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop and apply a framework for estimating the potential global-scale impact of reservoir construction on riverine sediment transport to the ocean. Using this framework, we discern a large, global-scale, and growing impact from anthropogenic impoundment. Our study links information on 633 of the world's largest reservoirs (LRs) (≥0.5 km3 maximum storage capacity) to the geography of continental discharge and uses statistical inferences to assess the potential impact of the remaining {\textgreater}44,000 smaller reservoirs (SRs). Information on the LRs was linked to a digitized river network at 30′ (latitude×longitude) spatial resolution. A residence time change (ΔτR) for otherwise free-flowing river water is determined locally for each reservoir and used with a sediment retention function to predict the proportion of incident sediment flux trapped within each impoundment. The discharge-weighted mean ΔτR for individual impoundments distributed across the globe is 0.21 years for LRs and 0.011 years for SRs. More than 40\% of global river discharge is intercepted locally by the LRs analyzed here, and a significant proportion (≈70\%) of this discharge maintains a theoretical sediment trapping efficiency in excess of 50\%. Half of all discharge entering LRs shows a local sediment trapping efficiency of 80\% or more. Analysis of the recent history of river impoundment reveals that between 1950 and 1968, there was tripling from 5\% to 15\% in global LR sediment trapping, another doubling to 30\% by 1985, and stabilization thereafter. Several large basins such as the Colorado and Nile show nearly complete trapping due to large reservoir construction and flow diversion. From the standpoint of sediment retention rates, the most heavily regulated drainage basins reside in Europe. North America, Africa, and Australia/Oceania are also strongly affected by LRs. Globally, greater than 50\% of basin-scale sediment flux in regulated basins is potentially trapped in artificial impoundments, with a discharge-weighted sediment trapping due to LRs of 30\%, and an additional contribution of 23\% from SRs. If we consider both regulated and unregulated basins, the interception of global sediment flux by all registered reservoirs (n≈45,000) is conservatively placed at 4–5 Gt year−1 or 25–30\% of the total. There is an additional but unknown impact due to still smaller unregistered impoundments (n≈800,000). Our results demonstrate that river impoundment should now be considered explicitly in global elemental flux studies, such as for water, sediment, carbon, and nutrients. From a global change perspective, the long-term impact of such hydraulic engineering works on the world's coastal zone appears to be significant but has yet to be fully elucidated.},

The essentials of a new Cross-Impact approach (Cross-Impact Balance Analysis, CIB) are outlined; it is of high methodological flexibility and is especially suitable for the use in expert discourses due to its transparent analytical logic. Due to its mathematical qualities it is also particularly well suited for the analytical integration of calculable system parts. An application of CIB to a project on the generation of electricity and climate protection is described. For a theoretical foundation of the CIB method relations to systems theory, especially to the theory of dynamic systems, are discussed. This explicates that CIB scenarios correspond to the solutions of slowly time-varying pair-force systems.},

Their impacts have inevitably generated growing controversy and conflicts. Resolving their role in meeting water and energy needs is vital for the future and illustrates the complex development challenges that face our societies. The Report of the World Commission on Dams: - is the product of an unprecedented global public policy effort to bring governments, the private sector and civil society together in one process - provides the first comprehensive global and independent review of the performance and impacts of dams - presents a new framework for water and energy resources development - develops an agenda of seven strategic priorities with corresponding criteria and guidelines for future decision-making. Challenging our assumptions, the Commission sets before us the hard, rigorous and clear-eyed evidence of exactly why nations decide to build dams and how dams can affect human, plant and animal life, for better or for worse. Dams and Development: A New Framework for Decision-Making is vital reading on the future of dams as well as the changing development context where new voices, choices and options leave little room for a business-as-usual scenario.},

	abstract = {Human population growth, economic development, climate change, and the need to close the electricity access gap have stimulated the search for new sources of renewable energy. In response to this need, major new initiatives in hydropower development are now under way. At least 3,700 major dams, each with a capacity of more than 1 MW, are either planned or under construction, primarily in countries with emerging economies. These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 \% to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet’s remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 \%. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the evaluation of functioning of the small dam reservoir localized in a loess agricultural catchment. During the survey, the reservoir had positive impact on water quality in supplying stream – the decrease of majority of the transported contaminants occurred, oxygen indicators were improved. Water flowing into the reservoir was characterized by insufficient quality. Extremely high phosphates concentration was recorded. Also CODCr, BOD5, NO2−, and Fe+ reached high values. In a consequence, a worsening of the stored water quality progressed. The excessive contaminants accumulation (including bottom sediments) and intensification of eutrophication processes greatly reduced the reservoir's usefulness for farming. Rational management and designing of a catchment (e.g. anti-erosion protection) should be one of the important elements at the process of water resources management.},
